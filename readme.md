# Pkmn Palette RNG

Pkmn Palette RNG is a small website with two simple features: get a random pokémon and change its colours (its palette). 

It is expected to be used as a "prompt generator" for artist that want to draw pokémon but don't know which one to pick and to give them the option for a more unique drawing (and more practising) with the random colours.

It's simple to use, simply press the pokémon button and then the colour button!

# About the project

It started because I wanted to draw pokémon but wanted random colours for them, and I couldn't find any website offering that. Since I also wanted to code and get some challenges (wasn't even sure it I could change the colours of an image at the start!), this sounded like the perfect weekend project.

Spoilers: it didn't take me only one weekend. But I did learn a bunch in the end and I'm happy with it!

# The code and it's future

I, Catoblepon, made this website, using the [Color.js](https://github.com/luukdv/color.js) package made by [Luukdv](https://github.com/luukdv). I hope to, in a future, add a small funny feature that would be playing "Who's that pokemon" but with all the pixels of the sprite being randomized colour.

The program is under the MIT License. Pokémon designs is propriety of [©2025 Pokémon](https://pokemon.com/), and the images have been obtained from [PokéSprite](https://msikma.github.io/pokesprite/index.html).
